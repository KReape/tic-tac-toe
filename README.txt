Howdy!

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe program. Here's how to run it:

When prompted with "1 or 2 players? (1/2)", input a 1 or a 2.

2 player games must be played on the same computer.


The tic-tac-toe board looks like this:
 ———————————
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 ———————————
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
 ———————————
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
 ———————————

When prompted with "Please choose where to place your X.", input the number that corresponds to the spot you want your X or O to be placed.

For example, inputting a 5 outputs this (in a 2 player game):
 ———————————
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 ———————————
| 4 | X | 6 |
 ———————————
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
 ———————————

That's really all there is to it! Thank you for choosing my program for all your tic-tac-toe needs.
